# Exercise  - Queries, queries, queries,... and Data analysis

## Objective

- Write queries for data analyses
- Write SQL queries combining online, callcenter and loyalty data avialable in Adobe Experience Platform
- Learn about Adobe Defined Functions

## Lesson Context

In this exercises you will write queries to analyse product views, product funnels, churn etc.

All queries listed in this chapter will be executed in your **PSQL command-line interface**. You should copy (CTRL-c) the statement blocks indicated with **SQL** and paste (CTRL-v)them in the **PSQL command-line interface**. The **Query Result** blocks show the pasted SQL statement and the associated query result.

## Exercise 1

Write basic queries for data analysis

### Timestamp

Data captured in Adobe Experience Platform is time stamped. The "timestamp" attribute allows you to analyse data over time.

How many product views do we have on a daily basis? 

**SQL**

```sql
select date_format( timestamp , 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS Day,
       count(*) AS productViews
from   fsi_demo_data_postvalues
where  web.webPageDetails.pageViews.value = '1.0'
group by Day
order by day desc
limit 10;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text
all-> limit 10;
    Day     | productViews
------------+--------------
 2020-02-06 |        16320
 2020-02-05 |        20822
 2020-02-04 |        20773
 2020-02-03 |        30356
 2020-02-02 |        20708
 2020-02-01 |        11211
 2020-01-31 |        11212
 2020-01-30 |        20636
 2020-01-29 |        20735
 2020-01-28 |        20818
(10 rows)

all=> 
```

### Top 5 products viewed

What are the top 5 products viewed?

**SQL**

```sql
select web.webPageDetails.name, count(*)
from   fsi_demo_data_postvalues
where  web.webPageDetails.pageViews.value = '1.0'
group  by web.webPageDetails.name
order  by 2 desc
limit 5;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text
all-> limit 5;
prod:all-> limit 5;
       name        | count(1)
-------------------+----------
 home              |   680022
 purchase: step 1  |   478634
 purchase: step 2  |   347305
 app: launch       |   324601
 voice: app launch |   318831
(5 rows)

all=>  
```

### Product Interaction funnel, from viewing to buying

**SQL**

```sql
select _experienceplatform.productData.productInteraction, count(*)
from   emea_ee_dataset_api
where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
and    _experienceplatform.productData.productInteraction is not null
group  by _experienceplatform.productData.productInteraction;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text
all=> 
all=> select _experienceplatform.productData.productInteraction, count(*)
all-> from   emea_ee_dataset_api
all-> where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
all-> and    _experienceplatform.productData.productInteraction is not null
all-> group  by _experienceplatform.productData.productInteraction;

 productinteraction | count(1) 
--------------------+----------
 productView        |     2260
 productAddToCart   |      554
 productPurchase    |      251
(3 rows)

all=>  
```


### Identify visitors with risk to Churn (visit page => Cancel Service)

**SQL**

```sql
select distinct _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
from   emea_ee_dataset_api
where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
and    web.webPageDetails.name = 'Cancel Service'
group  by _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
limit 10;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text
all=> 
all=> select distinct _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
all-> from   emea_ee_dataset_api
all-> where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
all-> and    web.webPageDetails.name = 'Cancel Service'
all-> group  by _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
all-> limit 10;
               ecid

```

In the next set of queries we will extend the above query, in order to get a complete view on the customers and their behavior that have been visiting the "Cancel Service" page. You will learn how to use the Adobe Defined Function to sessionize information, identify the sequence and timiong of events. You will also join datasets together to further enrich and prepare the data for analysis in Microsoft Power BI.

## Exercise 7.3.2

The majority of the business logic requires gathering the touchpoints for a customer and ordering them by time. This support is provided by Spark SQL in the form of window functions. Window functions are part of standard SQL and are supported by many other SQL engines.

### Adobe Defined Functions

Adobe has added a set of **Adobe Defined Functions** to the standard SQL syntax that allow you to better understand your experience data. In the next couple of queries you will learn about these ADF functions. You can find more information and the complete list via [Adobe IO](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/services/query-service/query-service.html#!acpdr/end-user/markdown/query-service/qs-queries-adobefunctions.md).

### What do people do on the site before reaching the "Cancel Service" page as the 3rd page in a session?

With this query you will discover the first two Adobe Defined Functions **SESS_TIMEOUT** and **NEXT**

> The **SESS_TIMEOUT()** reproduces the visit groupings found with Adobe Analytics. It performs a similar time-based grouping, but customizable parameters.

> **NEXT()** and **PREVIOUS()** help you to understand how customers navigate your site.

**SQL**

```sql
SELECT 
  webPage,
  webPage_2,
  webPage_3,
  webPage_4,
  count(*) journeys
FROM
  (
      SELECT
        webPage,
        NEXT(webPage, 1, true)
          OVER(PARTITION BY ecid, session.num
                ORDER BY timestamp
                ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING).value
          AS webPage_2,
        NEXT(webPage, 2, true)

        NEXT(webPage, 3, true)
           OVER(PARTITION BY ecid, session.num
                ORDER BY timestamp
                ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING).value
          AS webPage_4,
        session.depth AS SessionPageDepth
      FROM (
            select a._experienceplatform.identification.ecid as ecid,
                   a.timestamp,
                   web.webPageDetails.name as webPage,
                    SESS_TIMEOUT(timestamp, 60 * 30) 
                       OVER (PARTITION BY a._experienceplatform.identification.ecid 
                             ORDER BY timestamp 
                             ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
                  AS session
            from   emea_ee_dataset_api a
            where  a._experienceplatform.identification.ecid in ( 
                select b._experienceplatform.identification.ecid
                from   emea_ee_dataset_api b
                where  b._experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
                and    b.web.webPageDetails.name = 'Cancel Service'
            )
        )
)
WHERE SessionPageDepth=1
and   webpage_3 = 'Cancel Service'
GROUP BY webPage, webPage_2, webPage_3, webPage_4
ORDER BY journeys DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text

### How much time do we have before a visitor calls the call center after visiting the "Cancel Service" Page?

To answer this kind of query will we use the ``TIME_BETWEEN_NEXT_MATCH()`` Adobe Defined Function.

> Time-between previous or next match functions provide a new dimension, which measures the time that has elapsed since a particular incident.

**SQL**

```sql
select * from (
       select _experienceplatform.identification.ecid as ecid,
              web.webPageDetails.name as webPage,
              TIME_BETWEEN_NEXT_MATCH(timestamp, web.webPageDetails.name='Call Start', 'seconds')
              OVER(PARTITION BY _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
                  ORDER BY timestamp
                  ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
              AS contact_callcenter_after_seconds
       from   emea_ee_dataset_api
       where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
       and    web.webPageDetails.name in ('Cancel Service', 'Call Start')
) r
where r.webPage = 'Cancel Service'
limit 15;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text
               ecid               |    webPage     | contact_callcenter_after_seconds

### And what is the outcome of that contact?

Explain that we are joining datasets together, in this case we join our bt_website_interactions with bt_call_center_interactions. We do this to know the outcome of the callcenter interaction.

**SQL**

```sql
select r.*,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.callFeeling,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.callTopic,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.contractCancelled
from (
       select _experienceplatform.identification.ecid ecid,
              web.webPageDetails.name as webPage,
              TIME_BETWEEN_NEXT_MATCH(timestamp, web.webPageDetails.name='Call Start', 'seconds')
              OVER(PARTITION BY _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
                  ORDER BY timestamp
                  ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
              AS contact_callcenter_after_seconds
       from   emea_ee_dataset_api
       where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
       and    web.webPageDetails.name in ('Cancel Service', 'Call Start')
) r
, emea_call_center_interactions c
where r.ecid = c._experienceplatform.identification.ecid
and r.webPage = 'Cancel Service'
limit 15;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

### What is the loyalty profile of these customers?

In this query we join loyalty data that we have onboarded in Adobe Experience Platform. This allows to enrich the churn analysis with loyalty data.

**SQL**

```sql
select r.*,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.callFeeling,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.callTopic,
       l.loyaltystatus,
       l.crmid
from (
       select _experienceplatform.identification.ecid ecid,
              web.webPageDetails.name as webPage,
              TIME_BETWEEN_NEXT_MATCH(timestamp, web.webPageDetails.name='Call Start', 'seconds')
              OVER(PARTITION BY _experienceplatform.identification.ecid
                  ORDER BY timestamp
                  ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
              AS contact_callcenter_after_seconds
       from   emea_ee_dataset_api
       where  _experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
       and    web.webPageDetails.name in ('Cancel Service', 'Call Start')
) r
, emea_call_center_interactions c
, emea_loyalty_data l
where r.ecid = c._experienceplatform.identification.ecid
and r.webPage = 'Cancel Service'
and l.ecid = r.ecid
limit 15;
```

Copy the statement above and execute it in your **PSQL command-line interface**.

**Query Result**

```text

## Callcenter Interaction Analysis

In the queries above we only looked at the visitors that ended up contacting the callcenter in case of service cancellation. We want to take this a bit broader and take into account all callcenter interaction including (wifi, promo, invoice, complaint and contract).  

You will need to edit a query, so let's first open notepad or brackets.

On Windows click "search"-icon (1) in the windows toolbar, type **notepad** in the "search"-field (2), click (3) the "notepad" result:

![windows-start-notepad.png](../resources/windows-start-notepad.png)

On Mac

![osx-start-brackets.png](../resources/osx-start-brackets.png)

Copy the following statement to notepad/brackts:

```sql
select /* enter your ldap name */
       e._experienceplatform.identification.ecid as ecid,
       e.placeContext.geo.city as city,
       e.placeContext.geo._schema.latitude latitude,
       e.placeContext.geo._schema.longitude longitude,
       e.placeContext.geo.countryCode as countrycode,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.callFeeling as callFeeling,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.callTopic as callTopic,
       c._experienceplatform.callDetails.contractCancelled as contractCancelled,
       l.loyaltystatus as loyaltystatus,
       l.loyaltypoints as loyaltypoints,
       l.crmid as crmid
from   emea_ee_dataset_api e
      ,emea_call_center_interactions c
      ,emea_loyalty_data l
where  e._experienceplatform.brand.brandName like 'Luma Telco'
and    e.web.webPageDetails.name in ('Cancel Service', 'Call Start')
and    e._experienceplatform.identification.ecid = c._experienceplatform.identification.ecid
and    l.ecid = e._experienceplatform.identification.ecid;
```

And replace 

```text
enter your ldap name
```

Do not remove **/\*** and **\*/**. Your modified statement in notepad should look like:

Notepad:

![edit-query-notepad.png](../resources/edit-query-notepad.png)

Brackets:

![edit-query-brackets.png](../resources/edit-query-brackets.png)

Copy your modified statement from **notepad** into the **PSQL command line window** and hit enter. You should see the following result in the PSQL command line window:

```text
